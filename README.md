# Brazil vaccine-batches dataset

Project aimed at creating a public dataset for the COVID-19 vaccine batches sent to each of Brazil States by the Federal Government, between January to May 2021. 

The vaccine batches information is made available by the Brazilian government agency SAGE in PDF files, one file for each vaccine distribution phase. The PDF files are for transport (freight) invoices. They contain information about each batch (including its number and expiration dates).
